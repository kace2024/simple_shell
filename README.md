# Simple Shell

This is a group project by Abdallah Kacemi and EL MEHDI Mahdaoui for the ALX Software Engineering program. The project aims to create a simple UNIX command interpreter, often referred to as a "shell." 

## Project Schedule

- Start Date: September 6, 2023, 3:00 AM
- End Date: September 21, 2023, 3:00 AM
- Checker Release: September 19, 2023, 10:12 PM
- Auto Review: Launched at the deadline

## Concepts

In this project, we will be exploring the following concepts:

- Basics of programming
- Basics of C
- Basics of thinking like an engineer
- Group work
- Learning how to learn

## Background Context

This project involves creating a simple UNIX command interpreter, commonly known as a shell. It is a crucial project that challenges our programming skills, C knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork. The goal is not only to build a functional shell but also to deepen our understanding of programming and engineering concepts.

### Important Guidelines

- **No Code Copying**: We are strictly prohibited from copying code from other sources, including other students or online articles/videos. We are expected to write our own code from scratch and understand it thoroughly.

- **Learning to Learn**: The essence of this project is to learn how to learn. We should aim to understand the underlying principles and create our own solutions rather than looking for shortcuts or cheating.

- **Pair Programming**: This is a group project, and we should work together effectively. Both of us are responsible for the project's success, and we must ensure that both partners understand every line of code.

- **Plagiarism**: Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. We must create our solutions and not rely on external sources or others' work.

## Requirements

### General

- **Editors**: We are allowed to use vi, vim, emacs as text editors.
- **Compilation**: Our code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- **Newline**: All our code files should end with a newline character.
- **Documentation**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- **Coding Style**: Our code should follow the Betty style and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Memory Management**: We must ensure that our shell does not have any memory leaks.
- **Function Limit**: Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- **Header Files**: All header files should use include guards.
- **System Calls**: We should use system calls only when necessary.

## Compilation

To compile our shell, we can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
